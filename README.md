# Artist-Specific Music Generation | March 2019
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated high efficacy in areas related to NLP, Signal Processing and Image Processing in the last decade with a vast majority of traditional systems being replaced by AI. However, AI for use in recreation and artistic fields such as music and painting haven’t enjoyed much visibility except for a few niche systems. In this program we investigate the creation of music imitating a specific artist’s style, in this case Ludvig Von Beethoven’s style, using neural network. In particular, we will build a model using stacked LSTM units to produce noise free music. The LSTM approach involves remembering information for a long period of time as it is the case in music generation.  
 
For this program, we will use a dataset provided by the Classical Piano Midi. This page contains audio formats, scores or videos with visualizations of the scores during playing. http://www.piano-midi.de/mozart.htm. We are practically interested in the midi files of Beethoven. Finally, we will use Keras as the platform to develop our model 

## Result
Voted best among 3 AI models in music generation
